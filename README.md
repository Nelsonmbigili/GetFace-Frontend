# GetFace

## Overview
**[GetFace](https://getface-frontend.onrender.com/)** is a simple web application I created as a learning project for React and full-stack development.

The app uses the Face detection model from [Clarifai](https://clarifai.com/clarifai/main/models/face-detection) API to detect faces in images via URL input.

See the Backend on this [repository](https://github.com/Nelsonmbigili/GetFace-Backend)

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **API**: Clarifai face detection model

## What I Learned
Through developing this project, I gained valuable experience in:
- Building responsive UI components with React
- Creating RESTful APIs using Node.js
- Database design and management with PostgreSQL
- Integrating third-party APIs (Clarifai)
- Full-stack application architecture
- Deployment and hosting considerations

## How to Use
1. Visit the application URL
2. Register or log in 
3. Paste an image URL in the input field
4. Click "Detect" to see the face detection in action
